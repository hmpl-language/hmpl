HMPL is a fully documented module üìö with a wide range of usage methods. This guide will help you quickly start working on a new project or connect it to an existing one.

## Working with a document directly

You can start using it in your project right away without any JavaScript initializations. Just add 4 `script` tags.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <template hmpl>{{#request src="/api/my-component"}}{{/request}}</template>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/json5/dist/index.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/dompurify/dist/purify.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/hmpl-js/dist/hmpl.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/hmpl-dom/dist/hmpl-dom.min.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

When loading the page, your component will be installed immediately as soon as it comes from the server. You can also try the module in [Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/basic-hmpl-example-dxlgfg?file=%2Findex.html) online.

## Creating a project via a template

You can also use the Vite project template. It is cloned from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/hmpl-language/hello-hmpl-starter) using `npx degit`.

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Steps>

1. Clone the template:

   ```sh
   npx degit hmpl-language/hello-hmpl-starter hello-hmpl
   ```

2. Go to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd hello-hmpl
   ```

3. Install dependencies and run the project:

   ```sh
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

</Steps>

Once server is running, open your browser at Vite's server URL (printed in the terminal).
Now, let's create our first web application üå±!

## Project structure

The template consists of several files and a couple of folders. Made for the fastest and most flexible start, since using other templates, you constantly have to delete a bunch of unnecessary components.

import { FileTree } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<FileTree>

- mock
  - api.js
- public
  - hmpl.png
- src
  - hmpl
    - HelloWorld.hmpl
  - main.js
- .gitignore
- README.md
- index.html
- package.json
- vite.config.mjs

</FileTree>

Here, everything is modest, but practical.

## First component

### 1. Creating a file

To get started, let's say we have a file called `HelloWorld.hmpl` in the `/src/hmpl` directory, it will store the first component of your future application.

```hmpl
// HelloWorld.hmpl
<div>
  <div>
    {{#request
      src="/api/hello"
      after="submit:#form"
      repeat=false
      indicators=[
        {
          trigger: "pending",
          content: "<p>Loading...</p>"
        },
        {
          trigger: "rejected",
          content: "<p>Error!</p>;"
        }
      ]
    }}
    {{/request}}
  </div>
</div>
```

We added indicators here, since we are working with a server. They will be just text, but we could have added a gif with a loader.

### 2. Mounting a component into the DOM

Now, you need to make your component appear on the server. To compile the syntax of the template language into computer-readable js code, we use [hmpl-vite-plugin](/vite-plugin), which allows you to work with files of this extension. There is the same for [Webpack](/webpack).

But, this is connected in the project config, now let's go to `main.js`:

```javascript
// main.js
import helloWorld from "./hmpl/HelloWorld.hmpl";

const { response } = helloWorld();

document.body.appendChild(response);
```

We import `HelloWorld` as a [HMPL template function](https://spec.hmpl-lang.dev/#template-function). To make the request to server we invoke this template function. It returns a [HMPL instance object](https://spec.hmpl-lang.dev/#sec-hmplinstance) and the `response` property holds the components received from server and the request state indicator components.

Saving the files will render the component received from the server.

:::note
The responses are served by a mock server located in the `/mock` directory. You can modify these mock API responses to test different scenarios.

## Working with dynamic components

### 1. Create a Form Component

Similar to HelloWorld, let's create a simple registration form component where we only have a name. Let's call the file `Form.hmpl`.

```hmpl
<div>
  <form id="form" onsubmit="event.preventDefault()">
    <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Enter your name" />
    <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
  </form>

  {{#request
    src="/api/hello"
    after="submit:#form"
    repeat=false
    autoBody={
      formData: true
    }
    indicators=[
      {
        trigger: "pending",
        content: "<p>Loading...</p>"
      },
      {
        trigger: "rejected",
        content: "<p>Error!</p>;"
      }
    ]
  }}
  {{/request}}
</div>
```

Here, we will send `FormData` with our string to the server.

### 2. Load the Form Component to DOM

And also, you need to import this file into your `main.js`.

```javascript ins={2} ins={5} ins={8}
import helloWorldTemplate from './hmpl/HelloWorld.hmpl';
import formTemplate from './hmpl/Form.hmpl';

const { response: response as helloWorld } = helloWorldTemplate();
const { response: response as formEl } = helloWorldTemplate();

document.body.appendChild(helloWorld);
document.body.appendChild(formEl);
```

### 3. Submit the form

Now you can run the application and try to enter the name value. On the server, you can make a suggestion like `"${name} successfully registered!"` and do something similar if such a name already exists in the database.

## Or use as npm module

If you also, for example, use a framework and the connection methods are not very convenient, then you can connect it as a regular npm module and use it purely in javascript.

```javascript
import hmpl from "hmpl-js";

const templateFn = hmpl.compile(
  `<div>
      <button data-action="increment" id="btn">Click!</button>
      <div>Clicks: {{#request src="/api/clicks" after="click:#btn"}}{{/request}}</div>
  </div>`
);

const clicker = templateFn(({ request: { event } }) => ({
  body: JSON.stringify({ action: event.target.getAttribute("data-action") })
})).response;

document.querySelector("#app").append(clicker);
```

It is worth noting that the assembly does not include `hmpl-dom`, it must be installed together with `hmpl-js`.
