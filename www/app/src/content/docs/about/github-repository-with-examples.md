The [repository](https://github.com/hmpl-language/examples) has a list of several example projects. There you can find examples with and without webpack, as well as a test local server.

## Gallery App

A flower gallery application with pagination functionality. The images, as well as the name of the application itself, are uploaded from the server.

## Landing Page

A landing page where the components are completely located on the server, so the original application file weighs only a couple of kilobytes.
