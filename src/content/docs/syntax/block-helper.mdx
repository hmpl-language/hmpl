import { Icon } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

In template language terminology, there is such a thing as a block helper. You may have heard it in Handlebars <Icon class="docs-inline" name="seti:mustache"  />, but in HMPL specifically it is different from what is meant there.

## What is this?

In HMPL, these are some components that are not actually components, but are interpreted as components in the layout. That is, by writing such a block, you have written a `template` tag.

```hmpl
{{#request src="/api/clicks" after="click:#btn"}}{{/request}}
```

It also has attributes and nested elements. You can also add it anywhere in HTML.

:::note
It is worth considering that in the DOM tree, compiled helper blocks are replaced with comments of the form `<!--hmpl1-->`, `<!--hmpl2-->`, etc., when there is no explicit response from the server.

## Structure

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Steps>

1. All block helpers start with opening double curly braces `{{`. Today, this is the gold standard for template languages, used in many of them. Next comes the special symbol `#`, which lets the compiler know that this is a block helper, and then comes its name (`request` as an example), a list of [attributes](/syntax/attribute), and closing two curly braces `}}`.

   ```hmpl
   {{#request ...}}
   ```

2. Next comes the body of the block helper. This can **only** be another block helper, or HTML.

   ```hmpl
   {{#indicator}}{{/indicator}}
   ```

   or

   ```html
   <div>Loading...</div>
   ```

3. And last, as in HTML, comes the closing "tag". It consists of the same thing as the opening "tag", except that it does not have a list of attributes and instead of `{{#...}}` it begins with the slash symbol `{{/...}}`.

   ```hmpl
   {{/request}}
   ```

</Steps>

## About nesting

Nesting in HMPL strictly depends on which block helper you use. The documentation specifies these nesting rules for each of them.
